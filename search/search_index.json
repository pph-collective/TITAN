Starting with the initializing agent population, TITAN iterates over a series of stochastic interactions where agents can interact with one another, transmit infections through various medium, and enter and exit the care continuum. The purpose of TITAN is to evaluate the impact of prevention and treatment models on incidence and prevalence rates of the targeted disease(s) through the use of data fitting simulated trajectories and rich statistics of primary/sub-population attributable proportions. Agent populations are defined as graphs (nodes connected by edges). Nodes in the graph are used to represent the attributes (or collection of attributes) of an agent (person), and edges define the type of relationship between agents. In practice, a graph represents a social network of connected people through various relationship types, and provides the medium for which agents can interact.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"TITAN (Treatment of Infectious Transmissions through Agent-based Network) is an agent-based simulation model used to explore contact transmission in complex social networks.

We use the following guidelines to ensure standards are met. GitHub Workflow When working on TITAN, make a branch from develop to make changes in, then make a pull request to develop when ready for review. Branches develop is the primary working branch for the project main is the branch releases are made off of and is in stable condition at all times topic branches are created for new features, fixes, or really any changes Commitizen All commits should use the angular style.

Code Standards Testing We strive to have test coverage for all of the features of TITAN. When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, add tests for the new feature or that test the bug condition to make sure that the bug doesn't crop up agin. pytest is the library used for testing.

Start a python session from the root directory of TITAN , and follow along! We'll use the sample params file tests/params/basic.yml in all of these examples, but feel free to use a different one. Here is how to perform the basic steps of running the model: from titan.parse_params import create_params from titan.model import TITAN outdir = 'results' params = create_params ( None , 'tests/params/basic.yml' , outdir ) model = TITAN ( params ) model . run ( outdir ) This creates a params object using no setting (the None ), our test params, and tells create_params to put our computed params file in a directory called results . the 'results' directory must already be created We then use those params to create our model, and run it. We also have the model results saved to our results directory. We should now see a params.yml in our 'results' directory, and some reports showing what happened at different timesteps in the model. If we wanted to debug something, or look at a very specific metric that wasn't in our reports, we could instead step through the model one time-step at a time. Resuming from our code above, here's how we could do that. model2 = TITAN ( params ) start_time = 0 end_time = 10 for i in range ( start_time , end_time ): model2 . time = i # update the model's time model2 . step ( outdir ) # do some introspection here, like... print ( model2 . pop . haart_counts ) # make sure the model state is reset for a new time step model2 . reset_trackets () If we want to write and read in a population instead of letting the model create one... from titan import population_io as pio from titan.population import Population from copy import deepcopy # let's make a copy of our params and tinker with the population a bit params2 = deepcopy ( params ) params2 . demographics . white .
