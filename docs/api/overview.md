## Overview

`titan-model` includes a number of "internal" and "external" classes and functions.
Typically, users will interact through the `run_titan.py` script, though some utility
may be found through using the more internal functions, such as creating a population
with the `Population` class or a model with the `TITAN` class. This API 
information is intended as reference for users to understand how the model works
under the hood.
